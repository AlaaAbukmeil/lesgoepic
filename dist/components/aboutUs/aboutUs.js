          LesGo Epic aspires to connect more people through social events where
          participants meet different people with diverse backgrounds in fun and
          engaging activities. These activities push participants to socialize
          with one another as they usually require them to team up and overcome
          challenges in a safe environment. Our events inspire people to connect
          with one another over memorable, value-driven experiences.
